        <h2>Custom Widgets Lab</h2>
        <p>IBM provides a number of widgets that can surface Connections content in a very structured format. 
          But what about non-Connections content? In this lab, you will learn the best practices for building and 
          managing your own widgets to surface external content or applications alongside Connections content. 
          We'll describe the steps and show you running code. 
          You'll leave with a firm grasp of the basics of building widgets for ICEC and be ready to start creating 
          your own.
