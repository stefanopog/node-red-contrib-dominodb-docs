### Clone the ICEC Widgets starter repository
We have created a repository to help you get started fast; you will **NOT** need to install or configure tools like Babel, Express, ngrok, or Webpack. They are preconfigured so that you can focus on your widget code.

To clone this repository, run this command from the terminal window:
```
git clone https://github.com/icstechsales/icec-widgets-starter.git
```


### Open the repo directory in VS Code
Click on the **Open folder** on the **Welcome** page 

Navigate to the icec-widgets-starter directory and click **Select Folder** (on a Mac, click **Open**).
