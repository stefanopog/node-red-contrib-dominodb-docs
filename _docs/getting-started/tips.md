Sometimes during widget development you may run into an issue.  Common issues as they are encountered will be documented here in a short video.

<hr>
#### Copy sample code

<p>
Throughout the lab you will find code blocks like the one below. 
</p>

```javascript
console.log("sample code");
```
<p>
You can use the icon found in the upper right hand corner of the code block to more easily copy the code sample to your clipboard.

<hr>
#### ICEC Page is loaded empty without a Customize button

<p>
You may encounter a problem with the ICEC page not loading and/or the Customize button not showing up on the page.  This is likely due to having made a mistake inside the custom.js file and the script not running to completion.  This short clip will demonstrate how to resolve this issue.  
</p>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary video-btn" data-toggle="modal" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yj6M8qs7U8" data-target="#videoModal">
  Play clip
</button>

*Note*: Once the video loads, switch to the full screen option for a better viewing experience.

<div class="modal fade" id="videoModal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="exampleModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">
  <div class="modal-dialog" role="document">
    <div class="modal-content">
        <div class="modal-header">
            <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close">
                <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
            </button>        
            <h4 class="modal-title">Empty page w/o a Customize button</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
